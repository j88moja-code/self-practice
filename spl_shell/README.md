# SPL SHELL
## About

This program is an interactive program for production lead to manage shift production.
The program is used to capture production data and the outputted data can assist tge spl to make data based decisions.
Inspired by a simple_shell project which the author was doing as part of ALX Softeware Engineering Progamme.
It is called a shell because it uses the similar principles only difference being that it does not interact withe kernel but it will manipulate data which can assist the spl.
